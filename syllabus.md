# RESCUER Workshop 4 Syllabus

## Collaborative Software Development for PhD Students
Lead by: [Mario Morales Hernandez](https://github.com/moraleshernm)
- What we will cover (high‑level, intentionally non‑specific)
- Quick setup and tool checks (including git and an editor)
- Core version‑control concepts with git (branches, remotes, simple workflows)
- Collaborative change proposals and review practices (PRs and feedback)
- Principles for resolving conflicts and recovering from common mistakes
- Lightweight documentation habits for research code and reproducibility
- Basic testing practices and how to make tests useful for research work
- Simple automation to catch issues early (pre‑commit / CI concepts)
- Hands‑on, paired exercises to practice collaboration skills on a small project
- Guidance for common lab scenarios and practical troubleshooting

- Introduce/review concepts from HPC related architectures and modeling
    - Basic operations: FLOPs, memory access, computational intensity
    - Memory: layout, types of memory, buses, caches
    - Classification: Flynn's taxonomy, Moore's law, Amdahl's law
    - Threads vs. Processes
    - Task vs. Data parallelism
    - Partitioning and load balancing
    - Scalability
